# It is Important to Learn Coding Concepts. But what are they?
<Metadata date={[2, 24, 2022]} />

Have you ever got tired of hearing "learn coding concepts", but then have no idea what these concepts are? Well you're not alone. I used to have that feeling for a long time. Whenever I hear "learn the concepts of Python, JavaScript", I'm always like "Alright cool, what are the concepts or how can I find them".

This is the reason for this article to help you understand what coding concepts are and how to find them in different levels of programming. If you are already know this, then this isn't for you, but you can still stick around as you may find one or two things to learn from (or maybe not :)).

Now this isn't the article where you will find the author quoting different philosophers or bringing up different philosophy, idealogy, whateverology just to explain what concepts are. No, this is different, this is how I see (not "find") concepts, I am just going to say what I know about it and I'll be out of your way. This article is going to base on what concepts are, examples of concepts outside the coding world, how to learn the concepts in coding.

Alright let's jump right in.

## What are concepts

Concepts are simply ideas. They are the ideas that form the basic structure of a thing. When you say for example, what's the idea behind this thing, you are literally saying what is this thing based on, how and why does this thing do what it does. Concept is simply understanding how and why a thing works.

For example, they tell you; "don't use your phone in your kitchen close to a cooking gas", ok why?, "because it may explode", hmm but how? When you get an answer to such questions you would end up understanding the principle that that thing
